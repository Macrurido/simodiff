All sigmoid models are fitted using the `optim()` function for each data set. Each
model is evaluated with the `nllb()` function, which calculates the negative
log-likelihood for the residuals under the assumption of a binomial distribution.

Within a function, an empty list named 'l_models' is created to hold the summaries of each fit.

## Arguments

The arguments in the function are as follows:

    model  A list that stores the functions of selected models for fitting a   cumulative density function.
    prm    A list that contains the parameter values b1 and b2 of the selected model.
    lista  A list where the first item contains the original data, and items 2 to B+1 contain the resampled data frames.
    B    An integer that determines the number of resamplings.

## Returns

The function returns a list containing the stored summaries.

## Import from
  optim() from the stats package
  na.omit from the stats package

## Sea also
     Model functions from simodiff package: GoM(), HiM(), LoM(), WeM() and GaM()
     
## Example

This example uses the `Lperu` dataset, which is included in a `simodiff` package.
The dataset contains three variables: sex, length (cm), and binomial, indicating
reproductive conditions with 0 for inactive and 1 for active reproductive organisms.

First, a list of `models` to be analyzed is created. Next, the initial values of
the parameters are set in `prm`. After that, the frequencies and proportions of
reproductively active organisms are calculated for both the original sample and
the B resamples using the function `simodiff::f_resample()`. Finally, the number
of resamplings, denoted as `B`, must be defined by the researcher.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
set.seed(16)

# The database
df <- load("data/Lperu.rda")
df <- df[-1]
df <- Lperu

# Frequencies and proportions of reproductively active organisms 
Imin <- (trunc(min(df$Length)/5))*5
Imax <- (ceiling(max(df$Length)/5))*5
bin <- 5

B <- 3
n <- dim(df)[1]

f_resample <- simodiff::resample(df, B, n, Imin, Imax, bin)
f_resample

#  List of `models` to be analyzed
models <- list(GoM=simodiff::GoM, HiM=simodiff::HiM,
                LoM=simodiff::LoM, WeM=simodiff::WeM,
                GaM=simodiff::GaM)

 prm <- list(GoM=c("b1"=38,"b2"=0.1), HiM=c("b1"=38,"b2"=10),
             LoM=c("b1"=38,"b2"=5), WeM=c("b1"=38,"b2"=6),
             GaM=c("b1"=21,"b2"=1.8))

 fits <- fit_models(models, prm, lista=f_resample, B)
 fits
```

## The function

```{r, }
fit_models <- function(models, prm, lista, B){
          # The list includes the original and de B resampled data sets.
              B <- B+1 
          # Create an empty list to store the model summaries.
              names_M <- names(models)
              l_models <- sapply(names_M, function(x) NULL)
          # Nested for loop to fit the ith model for jth data set.
            for(i in 1:length(models)){
                  model <- unlist(models[[i]])
                  betas <- unlist(prm[[i]])
              for(j in 1:B) {
                  df <- na.omit(lista[[j]])
                  l_models[[i]][[j]] <- optim(par= betas, fn= nllb, df= df,
                                              model= model)
              }
          }
            return(l_models)
 }

```
