The function utilizes ggplot2 to create a scatterplot that displays class
marks against the relative frequency of active organisms in relation to reproduction
(points) in a binomial distribution. The estimated value **y_hat** (solid line),
is calculated based on the chosen model.

where: the candidate model function was defined and stored in the `models` list;
the starting parameters values was defined and stored in the `prm` list; and the `x`
represents the independent variable.

To use this function, a data frame named `df` is required. This data frame should
include the class mark values `x`, the corresponding relative frequencies `y`,
and the estimated values of the independent variable `y_hat`.

The labels for the X and Y axes were defined in `x_label` and `y_label`, respectively.

Due to potential **Na** values, a warning may appear indicating that rows with
missing values or values outside the scale range have been removed.

## Arguments

The arguments in the function are as follows:

    df      A data frame with three variables (columns): the independent (x),
             observed (y), and predicted (y_hat).
    x_label A character vector with the label for the X-axis.
    y_label A character vector with the label for the y-axis.

## Returns

The function outputs a customized scatter plot

## Import
ggplot2
tidyverse

## Example

In this example, fictitious data are used, `x` corresponds to the class mark, the
corresponding relative frequencies `y`, and the estimated values of the independent
variable `y_hat`. The estimated value `y_hat` is calculated based on the chosen model
and their parameters `prm`. The Hill model function `simodiff::HiM()` serves as an
example. The labels for the X and Y axes are referred to as `x_label` and `y_label`,
respectively.


```{r, warning=FALSE}
x <- seq(5,70, by=5)
y <- c(0.00, 0.06,0.05, 0.20, 0.45, 0.70, 0.88, 0.93, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00)

b1 <- 27
b2 <- 8
prm <- c("b1"=b1,"b2"=b2)
y_hat <- HiM(prm, x)
df <- cbind(x, y, y_hat)
df <- as.data.frame(df)
x_label <- "Class mark (cm)"
y_label <- "Proportion"
p <- splot(df, x_label, y_label)

```

## The function

```{r, eval = FALSE}
splot <- function(df, x_label, y_label){
  p <- ggplot(df, aes(x= df[,1], y= df[,2])) +
              geom_point(colour = "midnightblue", alpha = 0.5) +
              labs(x= x_label, y= y_label) +
              geom_line(aes(x= df[,1], y= df[,3]), lty = 1)
  print(p)
}
```
