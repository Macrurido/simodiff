The `glad()` function assists in graphically approximating the initial parameters
needed to fit a model using a functional optimizer.

This is a nested function that stores the values of the start parameters graphically
determined for the models you want to analyze. The `glad in()` function is
encapsulated within the main `glad()`.

To use this function, both the models and their corresponding parameters must be
previously defined and stored in their respective lists—one for models and one for
parameters.The initial parameter values are set by the researcher based on their experience.

Each of the models is analyzed through a for loop. The parameters values are 
adjusted visually by using a plot, aiming to find a suitable starting value. If 
the user is satisfied with the values, they are stored in the list `prm[[i]]` 
and the next model continues; otherwise, the loop is repeated until the user is
content with the approximations.

The plot of the observed and predicted data using a sigmoidal model is
displayed in a separate window. The estimated value `y_hat` (solid line),
is calculated based on the chosen model and the respective initial or revised
values of the parameters: `y_hat <- models[[i]](prm[[i]],x)`.

The model and the values of parameters b1 and b2 are shown in a plot and the 
console output.

![glad_plot](https://github.com/Macrurido/simodiff/blob/master/man/figures/glad_plot.png)

The console prompts you with the question: **Are you happy with the model values? 1=Yes, 0= No**
If you choose 1, it means "yes," and if you choose 0, it means "no."
Type the appropriate number and press Enter.

> **_NOTE:_** The `glad()` function must be executed in the console; when run from
RMarkdown, the prompt appears, but the figure does not.

If you type 0, you will need to provide the new values for parameters b1 and b2.
Enter the new value for b1 and press Enter, then do the same for b2.

If you accidentally press Enter without entering a number, the default return
value will be NA.

## Arguments

The arguments in the function are as follows:

    models A list that contains the functions of the models.
    prm A list that contains the parameters values for each model.
    df A data frame with the x (class mark), y (proportion) and an empty column y_hat filled with NA
    x_label A character vector with the label for the X-axis.
    y_label A character vector with the label for the y-axis.
    
## Returns

The function returns a list with the new parameter values.

## Example

First, a list of `models` to be analyzed is defined. Second, the initial values of
the parameters are established in `prm`. A data frame containing the class mark and
mature proportion is created `df`.The variable `i` represents the number of models
that will be evaluated. Finally, the labels for the x-axis and y-axis are defined
as `x_label` and `y_label`, respectively.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
i <- 1

models <- list(GoM=simodiff::GoM, HiM=simodiff::HiM, 
               LoM=simodiff::LoM, WeM=simodiff::WeM,
               GaM=simodiff::GaM)

prm <- list(GoM=c("b1"=38,"b2"=0.1), HiM=c("b1"=38,"b2"=10),
            LoM=c("b1"=38,"b2"=5), WeM=c("b1"=38,"b2"=6),
            GaM=c("b1"=21,"b2"=1.8))

x <- seq(16.25,66.25, by=2.5)
y <- c(0.06, 0.00, 0.01, 0.01, 0.08, 0.04, 0.04,
       0.06, 0.58, 0.42, 0.69, 0.80, 1.00, 0.83,
       1.00, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00, 1.00,  NaN, 1.00)

df <- cbind(x, y)
df <- as.data.frame(df)

x_label <- "Class mark (cm)"
y_label <- "Proportion"

prm <- glad(models, prm, df, x_label, y_label)
```

## The function

```{r, eval = FALSE}
glad <- function(models, prm, df, x_label, y_label){
  x <- as.numeric(df[,1])
  for(i in 1:length(models)){
    betas<- glad_in(i, models, prm, df, x, x_label, y_label)
    prm[[i]] <- as.numeric(betas)
  }
  return(prm)
}
```
